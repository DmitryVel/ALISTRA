Analysis of Monocle Lineage Branches

This package is an extension of monocle3 (https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3) that allows isolating trajecory branches corresonding to individual lineages, identifying lineage-specific dynamically expressed genes, classifying genes based on their expression pattern and plotting gene expression along multiple lineages.
